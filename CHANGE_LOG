v1.162  Jan 22, 2018
    FSK extension: support for EFR Teleswitch stations (130-140 kHz in Europe).

v1.161  Jan 21, 2018
    Actually enable the FSK extension.
        Add more baud and shift values to menus.
        Improvements to the framing tool.

v1.160  Jan 20, 2018
    Fixed FSK menu bug.

v1.159  Jan 20, 2018
    Navtex: add frequency to DX mode, next/prev menu entry buttons.
    Added FSK extension. A work in progress. Not all framing modes seem to work.

v1.158  Jan 17, 2018
    Add Navtex DX mode. Each new message prints a single line containing a timestamp,
        header information and the first 80 characters of the message.

v1.157  Jan 16, 2018
    Fix user display on admin status tab
    Add volume URL parameter, e.g. kiwisdr:8073/?vol=100
        vol = 0 to 200(%), default is 50%

v1.156  Jan 12, 2018
    Fixed FAX frequencies: Athens (way off) and Northwood UK 4 MHz (100 Hz error).
    Added GPS tracking PLL IQ display to admin interface.
    Added scope display to Navtex extension.

v1.155  Jan 3, 2018
    Navtex extension:
        Add baud error indicator.
        Add HF frequencies menu.
        Text window clear button.
        Mark/space invert checkbox.
    Another fix to NDB database lookup function.
    API fix for antenna switch extension.

v1.154  Jan 2, 2018
    New Navtex extension.
    Major user interface changes:
        New “option tab” user interface for lower right control panel.
        Removed lower left status panel. Replaced with the new "Users" and "Stats" option tabs.
        Next/previous history buttons next to frequency entry box.
            If using a keyboard press return key to select displayed frequency.
            Otherwise prior frequency will return after three seconds.
            Doesn't really work yet for mobile devices.
        Added numeric dBm value to S-meter.
        Added classic LMS denoiser and autonotch to audio tab. Filter controls on extension panel.
            The LMS filters are not a panacea for all filtering problems.
            They are tricky to adjust and don't work in all situations.
            The presets are a work-in-progress.
        Added audio mute icon/button to right of spectrum button (renamed "Spec" to fit).
        WF option tab
            Number after "WF" on option tab button is current zoom level, e.g. "WF10"
            "Auto Scale" button: automatically sets WF min/max.
                Best when there are a range of signal levels.
            "Slow Dev" button: Use when you have audio drops on slow mobile devices (e.g. old iPad).
                Uses single color in spectrum and slower waterfall speed.
            "colormap" & "contrast" menus: beginnings of waterfall colormap control. Work-in-progress.
            "spec filter" menu: variable spectrum time constant so decay time can be varied.
        Add URL parameter to set initial waterfall speed:
            wf={0, off, 1, 1hz, s, slow, m, med, f, fast} e.g. kiwi:8073/?wf=1hz
        Fixed problem with NDB database lookup not working.
        Removed “less buffering” and “compression” buttons from Audio tab until they are working.

v1.153  Dec 7, 2017
    Add threshold slider to noise blanker.

v1.152  Dec 6, 2017
    First attempt at adding a noise blanker.
    Added variable speed waterfall ("WF rate" slider)
    Now on extended control panel, via "more" button:
        The "WF max" slider.
        Sound "Less buffering" (formerly "SND") and "Compression" buttons.
    Loran-C extension: fix truncated display for larger GRI values.

v1.144  Nov 17, 2017
    Improvements to IBP scanner extension from VE3SUN (see http://ve3sun.com/KiwiSDR/IBP)
    Automatically position extension data display when browser window resized.

v1.143  Nov 13, 2017
    Added this CHANGE_LOG file.
    Fixed crash caused when invalid numeric entries used in label edit panel.
    Stop IBP_scan waterfall annotations after extension closed.

v1.142  Nov 12, 2017
    New repository https://github.com/jks-prv/Beagle_GPS
    A version of KiwiSDR with the SDR code removed for people who only want to experiment with GPS.
    Easier to understand and compiles faster than full KiwiSDR repo.
    Except for the FPGA simulation, this is a replacement for http://www.jks.com/sdgps/sdgps.html

v1.141  Nov 7, 2017
    Admin webpage tab has textarea input for HTML that is added to the <head> element of
    the main page. Useful to add for example Javascript to setup Google analytics.

v1.140  Nov 1, 2017
    Bug fix allowing IQ mode in labels (kiwi.config/dx.json file).

v1.139  Nov 1, 2017
    New IQ demodulator mode (button to the right of NBFM) that, among other things, allows
    DRM decoding using the external Dream application. Requires use of
    "virtual audio cable" software on your computer to route the browser audio output to the
    input of Dream or other app. See the KiwiSDR forum for details.

v1.138  Oct 25, 2017
    Improvements from VE3SUN:
        IBP: Waterfall annotation of IBP station callsign.
        IBP: Waterfall autosave to jpg file.
        "DX cluster lookup" right-button menu entry.
        25-entry last frequency memory. Use keyboard up/down keys to access.

v1.137  Oct 16, 2017
    Security improvements:
        No more storage of admin password in cookies.
        Create file kiwi.config/opt.no_console to disable root console capability completely.
        File kiwi.config/opt.admin_ip can limit admin connections to single ipv4/ipv6 address
        on the local network (put ip address in file).
        Note: for security reasons it makes no sense to put these options _in_ the admin webpage.

v1.136  Oct 11, 2017
    Update needed because kiwisdr.com moved to a new server.

v1.135  Oct 8, 2017
    Bug fix in time limit exemption password code.

v1.134  Oct 8, 2017
    Bug fix in time limit code.

v1.133  Oct 8, 2017
    Fix top bar congestion. As the window width is narrowed (or for small screen devices) items
    on the top bar will be removed. Before the items would overlap making them unreadable.

v1.132  Oct 2, 2017
    Bug fix.

v1.131  Oct 2, 2017
    Added 24hr per-ip address connect time limit to admin interface. Now you can limit how long
    a particular ip address can connect during a 24 hour period.
    Fixed S-meter residual color problem.

v1.130  Sep 30, 2017
    Added a GPS Azimuth/Elevation display option.
