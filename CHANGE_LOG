v1.144  Nov 16, 2017
    Improvements to IBP scanner extension from VE3SUN (see http://ve3sun.com/KiwiSDR/IBP)
    Automatically position extension data display when browser window resized.

v1.143  Nov 13, 2017
    Added this CHANGE_LOG file.
    Fixed crash caused when invalid numeric entries used in label edit panel.
    Stop IBP_scan waterfall annotations after extension closed.

v1.142  Nov 12, 2017
    New repository https://github.com/jks-prv/Beagle_GPS
    A version of KiwiSDR with the SDR code removed for people who only want to experiment with GPS.
    Easier to understand and compiles faster than full KiwiSDR repo.
    Except for the FPGA simulation, this is a replacement for http://www.jks.com/sdgps/sdgps.html

v1.141  Nov 7, 2017
    Admin webpage tab has textarea input for HTML that is added to the <head> element of
    the main page. Useful to add for example Javascript to setup Google analytics.

v1.140  Nov 1, 2017
    Bug fix allowing IQ mode in labels (kiwi.config/dx.json file).

v1.139  Nov 1, 2017
    New IQ demodulator mode (button to the right of NBFM) that, among other things, allows
    DRM decoding using the external Dream application. Requires use of
    "virtual audio cable" software on your computer to route the browser audio output to the
    input of Dream or other app. See the KiwiSDR forum for details.

v1.138  Oct 25, 2017
    Improvements from VE3SUN:
        IBP: Waterfall annotation of IBP station callsign.
        IBP: Waterfall autosave to jpg file.
        "DX cluster lookup" right-button menu entry.
        25-entry last frequency memory. Use keyboard up/down keys to access.

v1.137  Oct 16, 2017
    Security improvements:
        No more storage of admin password in cookies.
        Create file kiwi.config/opt.no_console to disable root console capability completely.
        File kiwi.config/opt.admin_ip can limit admin connections to single ipv4/ipv6 address
        on the local network (put ip address in file).
        Note: for security reasons it makes no sense to put these options _in_ the admin webpage.

v1.136  Oct 11, 2017
    Update needed because kiwisdr.com moved to a new server.

v1.135  Oct 8, 2017
    Bug fix in time limit exemption password code.

v1.134  Oct 8, 2017
    Bug fix in time limit code.

v1.133  Oct 8, 2017
    Fix top bar congestion. As the window width is narrowed (or for small screen devices) items
    on the top bar will be removed. Before the items would overlap making them unreadable.

v1.132  Oct 2, 2017
    Bug fix.

v1.131  Oct 2, 2017
    Added 24hr per-ip address connect time limit to admin interface. Now you can limit how long
    a particular ip address can connect during a 24 hour period.
    Fixed S-meter residual color problem.

v1.130  Sep 30, 2017
    Added a GPS Azimuth/Elevation display option.
